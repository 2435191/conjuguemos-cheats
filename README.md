# conjuguemos-cheats

## Before you use
### Description
An unauthorized command-line interface for uploading scores to conjuguemos.com. 
Use at your own risk (the website may change at any time and break things).
Despite the name, the author would really prefer if you didn't use his hard work to cheat, 
as learning a language is fun and rewarding!

### Files
- `cli.py`: the CLI wrapper. 
- `base.py`: contains the ConjuguemosInterface class.

### Dependencies
- `python3.8` or later
- `requests` library

### Important notes
- There is a `mode` setting (default `homework`). There isn't support for changing it (yet).
